Getting and cleaning data course project

The 'UCI HAR Dataset' available on coursera has been used for this analysis. 
It represents Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones and has been collected from acclerometers on a Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

The analysis is submitted in three files:
	1. final_tidy_data.txt
		This is the my final data set saved as a text file.
	
	2. run_analysis.R
		This is the code used in this analysis and it outputs the above data set file.

	3. codebook.md
		It describes the variables found in dataset.

Thank you.
